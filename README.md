# DS-Capstone-2025: CoralMD

CoralMD is my Pomona College Data Science Capstone project, developed under the guidance of the Data Science Program (Fall 2025). It explores what a multimodal, preventive, personalized-medicine dashboard could look like when genomic, wearable, and electronic health record (EHR) data are integrated into a single, clinically interpretable interface.

This repository contains the full CoralMD application source code as well as all capstone write-up materials.

## Project Overview

Modern healthcare systems are predominantly reactive, providing treatment only after symptoms appear. CoralMD attempts to prototype a more proactive, prevention-centered clinical platform. The system focuses on three primary goals:

### 1. Integrate multimodal data streams
CoralMD unifies genomic variants, wearable sensor data, patient encounters, and EHR records into a cohesive data model.

### 2. Provide transparent, explanation-first risk estimates
Rather than relying on opaque black-box models, CoralMD employs interpretable heuristics and rule-based scoring to generate patient-specific risk trajectories.

### 3. Create narrative, clinician-oriented visualizations
The system includes storyline-style progression views, signal breakdowns, risk ribbons, and interactive timelines that help surface why a patient’s risk changes over time.

CoralMD is implemented as a modular Streamlit web application with dedicated pages for genomics, wearables, EHR data, and longitudinal trajectory reasoning.
